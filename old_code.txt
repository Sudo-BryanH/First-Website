                I am a huge fan of volleyball, even if I don't play on any serious level myself. I have always considered volleyball to be simple but after doing research, I found the complex strategies to be fascinating. Therefore, this game requires some level of volleyball strategy and intuition, as well as a bit of luck. 
                In this game, players will be able to simulate a simplified version of volleyball. Users can choose their own teams with their own teams with players of varying traits as well as how the team will attack or defend their court. They will play against a few already made bots which have their own level of difficulty and playing tendencies. Users who want a game that is tedious, challenging but rewarding game will enjoy this game.</p>
