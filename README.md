## Introduction
This website will serve as my portfolio and about page. Rather than using my GitHub page to serve as an entry way to my works, this website will make it easier to share my programming passion and academic projects.

Here is a mockup of how the website may look:

## User Stories

**User Story 1:** Users will enter into a splash screen with just my name and the logo and buttons leading the user to see either the projects or the about me page

**User story 2:** In the projects page, users will be able to scroll through project ‘cards’ similar to how users can scroll through tiktoks. These cards have a short explanation of the project and gif demos

**User story 3:** An administrator will be able to have a UI to insert projects so they can appear as cards. They may also remove the card or change its order
