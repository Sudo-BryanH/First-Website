## Introduction
This Github Pages website will serve as my portfolio and about page. Rather than using my GitHub page to serve as an entry way to my works, this website will make it easier to share my programming passion and academic projects.

Here is a mockup of how the website may look:

## User Stories

**User Story 1:** Users will enter into the about webpage where there will be a slideshow of different featured projects. 

**User Story 2:** The about page will show my qualifications and a short writeup on myself.

**User story 3:** In the projects page, users will see previews of projects as cards. Hovering over the thumbnail will allow them to see what kind of skills were used for the project. Clicking "see more" will direct user to a detailed writeup of the project.

**User story 4:** An administrator will be able to have a UI to insert projects. They may also remove the project cards.
