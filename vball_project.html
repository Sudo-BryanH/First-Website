        <p><b>I am a huge fan of volleyball, even if I don't play on any serious level myself. I have always considered volleyball to be simple but after doing research, I found the complex strategies to be fascinating.
         Therefore, this game requires some level of volleyball strategy and intuition, as well as a bit of luck.</b><br> <br>
        In this game, players will be able to simulate a simplified version of volleyball. Users can choose their own teams with their own teams with players of varying traits as well as how the team will attack or
        defend their court. They will play against a few already made bots which have their own level of difficulty and playing tendencies. Users who want a tedious, challenging but rewarding game will enjoy.

    <!--Planning-->
    <div class="container-fluid portfolio-section">
        <h1 class="title">Planning, coding, and back to the drawing board</h1>
        <h2>Conceptual design and first drafts</h2>
        <p>
            <b>The first step was to have a working concept.</b> This involved a lot of conceptual drawings on how I expect the layout to work. 
            Questions on how the game should be coded out and how objects in the game would be represented such as the ball, players, different types of players had to be answered. 
            <br><br>
            Eventually I settled with the idea of representing the ball, court, the game itself, the teams and players as classes, while individual teams 
            and different player positions were concrete classes to the abstract team and player classes. The game will be made to run after declaring player numbers by running a function
            that starts the game and goes through a list of steps it repeats throughout the game. The flow of the game would look something like:
            <div class="flex-container width100">
                <div class="portfolio-half empty-rec">
                    <ol>
                        <li> If this is a new game, declare your players and any extra players you'd like on your roster, otherwise start a recovered game</li>
                        <li> A serve is made. The first serve is always received and goes to the setter</li>
                        <li> The side with the ball chooses which player (position) to hit and where to hit the ball</li>
                        <li> The side defending will move their players to guess where the opponent will hit the ball. If there is a defender where the ball lands, the ball is received.</li>
                        <li> If the ball is received, the defender becomes the attacker and vice versa. If the ball is not received, the winning side will be awarded a point and will server next</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <img class="small-thumbnail" src="pictures/vball_planning/Sketch0.png">
            </div>
            I also knew that I would eventually make a UI so I thought it best to derive a grided layout on how I imagine the game would be. To reduce the amount
            of variability I had to code out, I would have a standard position on the court for the players to move to. The following pictures are a rough draft 
            I drew up on how I thought the court should look:
            <div class="flex-container width100">
                <img class="small-thumbnail" src="pictures/vball_planning/Sketch1.png">
                <img class="small-thumbnail" src="pictures/vball_planning/Sketch2.png">
                <img class="small-thumbnail" src="pictures/vball_planning/Sketch3.png">
            
            </div>

            <b>With this in mind, I began coding.</b> I figured to start I should make this a console program to at least know the game worked (big mistake, but more on that later). 
            The coding went pretty smoothly with only minor debugging problems to fix. Unit-testing ensured that each function by itself works. Before long, I had a functional terminal game which, 
            while a hassle to play, was functional.

        </p>

        <h2>UI and concurrency pains</h2>
        <p>
        <b>My problems with this program did not really start until I started to implement a UI.</b> While I was able to get used to the Java Swing library to get my designs down, trying to 
        connect it to my current game proved to be difficult. To start off with, there was some bug causing the screen to go white whenever the game ran the function to draw
        the court. While I was never able to figure out why this did not work (and neither did the TA assisting me in that case), it was for the best because I had realized that trying 
        to run a synchronus, linear program was not suited to work with Java Swing's event driven paradigm, and I had to redesign how the game would be run.
        <br><br>
        While my original program was just a set of functions to be called on loop with changing states based on user console input, the UI was simply not designed to be worked like that. At the time, 
        I did not know of concurrency, synchrony, and asynchrony so while poking around example Java Swing projects, I realized that the UI works by having user input change the state of the program, rather 
        than having the program call functions repeatedly. Refactoring my program after that was much easier than it took to realize my problem. I made it so clicks of buttons 
        change the state of the game where I preprogrammed what happens in those states. For example, if I click next after a side attacks, then the program will go into the state where the opponent 
        will begin their attack and the side that just attacked will then defend.



        </p>

        <h2>Adding Features</h2>

        <p>
        <b>I began adding some extra features based on the user stories.</b> For one, I implemented a singleton design with a single private logging class. This class will have calls made to it to log vital 
        information which will be printed out at the end of the game. I also added a JSON reader and parser to read and write game data to a JSON file which can be retrieved when a player wants to load an old game.  
        </p>

        <!--If I were to go back...-->
        <h1>If I were to go back...</h1>
        <p>
        Were I to continue this project and fix or add things, here are things I would:
        <ul>
            <li>Fix a bug where the ball is not travelling as expected due to the loop providing the coordinates is not running synchronus to the animation of the ball.</li>
            <li>Add more functionality to the game. Firstly, I would add a blocking system, then I would meaningfully add player switching</li>
            <li>A multiplayer option, either over the network or on the same device</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
        <p>
        This project was my first big programming project. It was an massive exercise of problem solving, creative design, pride, and frustration. Through this project I had hands on experience 
        constructing software using test-first design, using the principles of OOP, and utilizing third party tools like APIs and libraries. This is far from a work of art, but I believe this project was the 
        first step of me becoming a knowledgeable developer.
